# Audio Visualizer

A collection of programs to display microphone audio in different ways.

I had some fun learning about sound processing, and wanted to create a few small programs which would react to sounds inputted through my microphone.

This was not entirely sucessful, but I may come back and edit these programs in the future, to make them a bit more refined.

I have one experiment that represents sound through a number of dots that converge at the center when a sound is detected, and spread out in silence. My other attempt uses a sin wave wrapped around a circle -
I used a formula linking polar coordinates and the equation for a wave to plot a number of small lines on every tick of the clock. These come together to form an image, which reacts dynamically to sounds.
I have some experience plotting circles using polar coordinates, but I needed a fair amount of help to get my formula to be what I wanted.
